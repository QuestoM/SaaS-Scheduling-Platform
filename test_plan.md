# Test Plan for Home Care SaaS Platform

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy and test cases for the home care scheduling SaaS platform. The testing approach covers unit testing, integration testing, and system testing to ensure all components work together properly and meet the requirements.

## Testing Objectives

1. Verify that the platform correctly implements all functional requirements
2. Ensure the scheduling algorithm produces optimal schedules
3. Validate client-staff matching functionality
4. Test travel time optimization and route planning
5. Verify key management system functionality
6. Ensure the platform is responsive and works on different devices
7. Validate data integrity and security measures

## Testing Environments

### Development Environment
- Local development machines
- Docker containers for services
- Local database instances

### Staging Environment
- Cloud-based staging servers
- Test database with sample data
- Simulated client and staff profiles

### Production-like Environment
- Mirrors production configuration
- Performance testing environment
- Security testing environment

## Testing Types

### 1. Unit Testing

Unit tests will focus on testing individual components and functions in isolation.

#### Framework and Tools
- Backend: Jest for Node.js services
- Algorithm: PyTest for Python scheduling algorithm
- Frontend: Jest and React Testing Library

### 2. Integration Testing

Integration tests will verify that different components work together correctly.

#### Framework and Tools
