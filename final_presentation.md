## Final Solution Presentation

### Executive Summary

We have successfully designed and developed a comprehensive SaaS scheduling platform specifically tailored for coordinating home care services. This platform addresses the critical challenges faced by home care providers, including:

1. **Efficient Client-Staff Matching**: Intelligently matches clients requiring home assistance with qualified staff based on skills, preferences, and availability
2. **Travel Time Optimization**: Minimizes travel times between client visits to maximize caregiver productivity
3. **Key Management**: Effectively tracks and manages physical keys for client homes, including handovers between staff
4. **Preference Accommodation**: Honors clients' preferred service times and caregiver preferences

The platform empowers coordinators and schedulers with powerful tools to construct and manage optimized schedules, resulting in improved operational efficiency, enhanced client satisfaction, and reduced administrative burden.

### Solution Overview

Our home care scheduling platform consists of several integrated components:

#### System Architecture

We've implemented a modern, scalable microservices architecture with the following components:
